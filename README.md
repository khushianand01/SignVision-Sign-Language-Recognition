# ✋ SignVision – Real-Time Sign Language Recognition  

**SignVision** is a real-time **Sign Language Recognition System** that uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Deep Learning** to recognize hand gestures and convert them into text.  
This project aims to bridge communication gaps for the **speech & hearing-impaired community** by providing an accessible AI solution.
